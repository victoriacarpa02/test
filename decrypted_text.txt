Python, one of the world's most popular programming languages, has a rich and fascinating history that spans over three
decades. Its development, driven by a vision for simplicity and readability, has made it a cornerstone of modern
programming and a preferred choice for developers across various fields. The Genesis of Python The story of Python
begins in the late 1980s with Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)
in the Netherlands. Van Rossum was involved in a project called the Amoeba distributed operating system and was
frustrated with the limitations of the existing programming languages. He sought to create a language that combined the
best features of others, emphasizing simplicity, readability, and extensibility. In December 1989, during the Christmas
holidays, van Rossum started working on a new project that would eventually become Python. He named the language after
the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus," reflecting his desire to make programming fun and accessible.
